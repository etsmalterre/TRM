// A deployed build reaches the phones on its own.
//
// The atelier phones run the installed PWA and never close it, so nothing
// ever navigates: until 2026-09-15 the only service-worker update check was
// the browser's own (a navigation, or at most once every 24 h), and once the
// new worker did install and claim the page — the SW calls skipWaiting() and
// clientsClaim() — the page kept running the OLD bundle, because the injected
// vite-plugin-pwa registration (`registerSW.js`) registers and does nothing
// else. A deploy could therefore sit unseen on a phone for a day or more.
//
// This module replaces that injected script (`injectRegister: null` in
// vite.config.ts) with the three things the phone actually needs:
//
//  1. Register the worker (what the injected script did).
//  2. ASK for updates: `registration.update()` every CHECK_MS and every time
//     the app comes back to the foreground. nginx serves sw.js with
//     `no-store`, and the browser bypasses the HTTP cache for the worker
//     script anyway (`updateViaCache: 'imports'`, the default, and sw.js has
//     no imports), so each check sees the build that is really on the server.
//  3. RELOAD once the new worker controls the page (`controllerchange`), so
//     the navigation is answered by the new worker's precached index.html and
//     the new hashed assets. Deferred while a write is in flight: a reload
//     in the middle of « Fin de pièce » would abort the request from the
//     phone's side while the server may still commit it, and the bonnetier
//     would not know which. The reload waits for the mutation cache to go
//     idle, then fires. Anything unsaved on screen (a draft consigne, a chosen
//     action not yet confirmed) is lost — a deploy is rare and on Vincent's
//     schedule, and identity survives (localStorage), so the phone comes back
//     on the same poste, with the same person, a few seconds later.
//
// Skipped:
//  - the very first registration: `clientsClaim()` fires controllerchange when
//    the worker first claims a page that had none. That is an install, not an
//    update, so a page with no controller at startup ignores its first claim.
//  - dev: `devOptions.enabled` is false in vite.config.ts, /sw.js does not
//    exist there, and a precaching worker in dev turns every edit into a
//    "why am I seeing the old build?" hunt.
